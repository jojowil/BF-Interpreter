# BF Interpreter

Using code examples from [Esolang's Hello World examples](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello,_World!)

This interpreter passes all of the Hello World versions that do not require OOB cell access in the arena.

There are both C11 and Java 14 versions of the code in the src folder.

Every effort has been made for these easy to understand using standard language components.

The interpreters are covered by the CC-BY-NC-SA license.

The examples are covered under [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and are from Esolang's site.

[hello1.b] is the complete copy of the highlighted text from Esolang.

[hello2.b] is the undecorated version of hello1.

[hello3.b] is a slightly more precise rendering of the output.

[hello4.b] is a more complex version that uses negaative numbers - supported by these interpreters.

[cellSize.b] calculates the site in bits of the the cells in the arena!

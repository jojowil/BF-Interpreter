# BF Interpreter

Using code examples from [https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello,_World!]

This interpreter passes all of the Hello World versions that do not require OOB cell access in the arena.

There are both C11 and Java 14 versions of the code in the src folder.

Every effort has been made for these easy to understand using standard language components.
